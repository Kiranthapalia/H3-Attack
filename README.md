  ### € Costa-Gazcón 2021: Practical Threat Intelligence and Data-Driven Threat Hunting Chapter 4: Mapping the Adversary
    - Mapping the adversary refers to gathering information about potential attackers, their techniques, procedures (TTPs), and the tools that are used by them       to carry out attacks.
    - The chapter covers following topics: The ATT&CK Framework, Mapping with ATT&CK and Testing yourself. 
    - The ATTCK Framework is a descriptive model that is employed to categorize and research the actions that a threat actor is capable of taking to establish a       foothold and conduct business inside an enterprise environment, a cloud environment, smartphones, or even industrial control systems.
    - The ATTCK Framework's beauty is that it gives the cybersecurity community a common taxonomy to describe adversary activities.
