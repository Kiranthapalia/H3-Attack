  ### € Costa-Gazcón 2021: Practical Threat Intelligence and Data-Driven Threat Hunting Chapter 4: Mapping the Adversary
    - Mapping the adversary refers to gathering information about potential attackers, their techniques, procedures (TTPs), and the tools that are used by them       to carry out attacks.
    - The chapter covers following topics: The ATT&CK Framework, Mapping with ATT&CK and Testing yourself. 
    - The ATTCK Framework is a descriptive model that is employed to categorize and research the actions that a threat actor is capable of taking to establish a       foothold and conduct business inside an enterprise environment, a cloud environment, smartphones, or even industrial control systems.
    - The ATTCK Framework's beauty is that it gives the cybersecurity community a common taxonomy to describe adversary activities.
    - There are 14 ATT&CK enterprise's tactics and  they are as follows: Reconnaissance, Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege             Escalation , Defense Evasion ,Credential Access ,Discovery, Lateral Movement ,Collection, Command and Control, Exfiltration, Impact.
    - A framework for comprehending and following cyberattacks is the ATT&CK matrix. It is a matrix of attack strategies and methods arranged in accordance with       the stages of the assault life cycle.
    - The matrix gives defenders a thorough understanding of the methods attackers can use to infiltrate systems and enables them to organize their defense and       mitigation efforts according to priority. Security professionals and companies frequently use the matrix to enhance their threat intelligence and               incident response capacities.
    - This ATT&CK Navigator is an excellent tool for visualizing a threat actor's methodology, the actions of a specific tool, or to create a security exercise.       Go to https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/enterprise/ to view the Navigator.

  ### Define tactic and give an example.
      An ATT&CK technique or sub-"why" technique's is represented by its tactics. The intention behind a move is the tactical objective of the enemy. An               opponent might want to obtain credential access, for instance.
